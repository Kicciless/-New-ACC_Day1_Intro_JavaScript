# Advanced Creative Coding - Day1 - Intro to JavaScript

A  functional task which includes various examples of mythological approaches of coding ie standard longhand coding, DRY, using arrows and  Ternary way of writing codes.

The following task concludes our Day1 intensive session into Creative Coding. Introducing us to the basic of JavaScript:

Task included the ‘largestNumber’;

where out of the following provided numbers, correctly identifies  each time to its user

Standarded Coded Way: 

*Create a const -  designating each number to a variable

*Use let 

*Then if/else statement to identify 

Array: 

Difference is only in where values are held. Instead of Invidually they are within the let variable - creating an array  

ie *let largestValue=computeLargestNumber(400,600,800);

Task included the ‘FizzBuzz Game’;

where numbers divisible by x provides either ‘Fizz’, ‘Buzz’ or ‘FizzBuzz’ outcome. 

In this sense every number divisible by 3 is deemed ‘Fizz’ and numbers by 5 are ‘Buzz’. 

*Create a custom function which holds your desired capacity of number 

*Use if / else statement to validate the statement above using (number%3==0) equals to (i%3==0) in our code 

*Ensure *If statement is first, followed by else if/  else statement after - to prevent miss calculations, when numbers are divisible to your conditions ie 15

objectDestructuring: 

similar to a data, all information of an individual from Name, Age, Gender … is stored

*Create a constant for each individual, holding all the information 

*function to print Individuals Name
